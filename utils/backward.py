def backward(self, gradient=None, retain_graph=None, create_graph=False):
        r"""Computes the gradient of current tensor w.r.t. graph leaves.

        The graph is differentiated using the chain rule. If the tensor is
        non-scalar (i.e. its data has more than one element) and requires
        gradient, the function additionally requires specifying ``gradient``.
        It should be a tensor of matching type and location, that contains
        the gradient of the differentiated function w.r.t. ``self``.

        This function accumulates gradients in the leaves - you might need to
        zero them before calling it.

        Arguments:
            gradient (Tensor or None): Gradient w.r.t. the
                tensor. If it is a tensor, it will be automatically converted
                to a Tensor that does not require grad unless ``create_graph`` is True.
                None values can be specified for scalar Tensors or ones that
                don't require grad. If a None value would be acceptable then
                this argument is optional.
            retain_graph (bool, optional): If ``False``, the graph used to compute
                the grads will be freed. Note that in nearly all cases setting
                this option to True is not needed and often can be worked around
                in a much more efficient way. Defaults to the value of
                ``create_graph``.
            create_graph (bool, optional): If ``True``, graph of the derivative will
                be constructed, allowing to compute higher order derivative
                products. Defaults to ``False``.
